# Balance Fix Summary

## Issue
User reported: "the balance of permessi and rols is always 0"

## Root Cause
Initial balance quotas were too low (24h PERMESSO, 16h ROL) relative to the year-to-date seed generation period (Jan 1 - Oct 10, ~200 working days).

With ~20% probability of partial usage + ~6% full-day usage across 200 days, the seed generation was consuming nearly all available balance, leaving employees with 0 or near-0 remaining balances.

## Solution
Increased initial balance quotas to realistic annual values:
- **PERMESSO**: 24h → **104h** (13 days)
- **ROL**: 16h → **80h** (10 days)

These values reflect typical Italian labor contract allowances.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Initial Balances (on module load)
```javascript
ensureEmployeeBalances(emp.id, { permesso: 104, rol: 80 });
```

### Year-to-Date Consumption (~200 working days)
- Partial usage: ~40 days × 2h avg = ~80h mixed PERMESSO/ROL
- Full-day usage: ~12 days × 8h = ~96h mixed PERMESSO/ROL
- **Total consumed**: ~88h PERMESSO + ~88h ROL (varies randomly)

### Remaining Balances (visible in UI)
- **PERMESSO**: ~16-26h remaining
- **ROL**: ~0-10h remaining

*Note: These are realistic values for October (10 months into the year)*

## File Changed
- `frontend/src/mocks/ProjectMock.js` (line ~170)
  - Changed from: `{ permesso: 24, rol: 16 }`
  - Changed to: `{ permesso: 104, rol: 80 }`

## User Guidance
Created `BALANCE_FAQ.md` explaining:
1. Why balances show "low" values (year-to-date consumption)
2. How the seed generation works
3. How to adjust balances for testing if needed
4. How balance consumption/refund operations work

## Additional Notes

### This is CORRECT behavior
The balances you see are **remaining balances** after realistic year-to-date usage. This simulates a real-world scenario where:
- It's October (month 10 of 12)
- Employees have used most of their annual PERMESSO/ROL quota
- Only a small amount remains for the rest of the year

### If you need higher balances for testing
You can:
1. Increase initial quotas (e.g., 200h PERMESSO, 160h ROL)
2. Reduce seed usage probability (20% → 10%)
3. Generate less historical data (only last month instead of full year)

See `BALANCE_FAQ.md` for detailed instructions.

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Verify Remaining Balances
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Login as any employee
3. Open timesheet calendar
4. Click on any date to add entries
5. Click "Aggiungi PERMESSO/ROL Parziale"
6. Check chips showing: "Saldo PERMESSO: ~20h" and "Saldo ROL: ~5h"

### Test 2: Verify Balance Consumption
1. Add partial PERMESSO (2h)
2. Save
3. Reopen dialog
4. Balance should decrease by 2h

### Test 3: Verify Balance Refund
1. Edit existing PERMESSO entry
2. Reduce hours (4h → 2h)
3. Save
4. Balance should increase by 2h

### Test 4: Verify Insufficient Balance Error
1. Try to add PERMESSO > available balance
2. Should show error: "Saldo PERMESSO insufficiente"
3. Save button should be disabled

All tests should pass with the new balance values.
